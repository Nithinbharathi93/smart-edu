## 🚀 Quick Start

---

## 🛠 Database Setup & Replication

To ensure local development environments match the production schema exactly, follow these steps to recreate the Supabase tables, RLS policies, and functions.

### 1. Prerequisites

- A [Supabase account](https://supabase.com/) and a fresh project.
- [Supabase CLI](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/cli) installed:

```bash
npm install supabase --save-dev

```

### 2. Environment Linking

Link your local environment to your personal Supabase project:

```bash
npx supabase link --project-ref <your-personal-project-id>

```

_Note: You will be prompted for your Database Password._

### 3. Recreating the Schema

We use a `schema.sql` file (generated via `db dump`) to maintain consistency. Run the following command to execute the script against your project:

```bash
npx supabase db execute --file schema.sql

```

**Alternative (UI Method):**

1. Open your **Supabase Dashboard** -> **SQL Editor**.
2. Copy the entire content of `schema.sql` from this repository.
3. Paste it into a new query and click **Run**.

### 4. Verification

Once the script completes, verify your setup:

- Check the **Table Editor** to ensure all tables (Users, Syllabus, Problems, etc.) are present.
- Ensure **Database Extensions** (like `pgvector` for PDF embeddings) are enabled if the script requires them.

---

### Pro-Tip: Database Migrations

If you make changes to the database structure, please do not edit `schema.sql` manually. Instead, use the migration workflow:

1. Create a migration: `npx supabase db diff -f name_of_change`
2. Push changes: `npx supabase db push`
